# WebScience

This is a Project designed to apply Graph Theory to a small set of the web.

In this Small app, the main class is Datamining/Datacompiler

It reads the scrambled data we collected using Web Crawlers, and convert it into a Network(Graph), with defined Vertices and Vertex.
This file can then be read by Gephi for network analysis.
